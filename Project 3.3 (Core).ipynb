    "Project 3 - Part 3 (Core)\n",
    "The project assignment is at the beginning of this week because you already have all of the background to complete project part 3 based on the first two weeks of the course!\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Problem\n",
    "For this project, you have been hired to produce a MySQL database on Movies from a subset of IMDB's publicly available dataset. Ultimately, you will use this database to analyze what makes a movie successful, and will provide recommendations to the stakeholder on how to make a successful movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3\n",
    "For part 3 of the project you will be practicing applying an E.T.L process on your previously saved movie data. Specifically, you will create a new MySQL database after preparing the data for a relational database.  You will export your database to a .sql file in your repository using MySQL Workbench.\n",
    "Specifications - Database\n",
    "Your stakeholder wants you to take the data you have been cleaning and collecting in Parts 1 & 2 of the project, and wants you to create a MySQL database for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should normalize the tables as best you can before adding them to your new database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: an important exception to their request is that they would like you to keep all of the data from the TMDB API in 1 table together (even though it will not be perfectly normalized).  \n",
    "You only need to keep the imdb_id, revenue, budget, and certification columns\n",
    "Required Transformation steps:\n",
    "Normalize Genre:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the single string of genres from title basics into 2 new tables.\n",
    "title_genres: with the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "tconst\n",
    "genre_id\n",
    "genres:\n",
    "\n",
    "genre_id\n",
    "genre_name\n",
    "Discard unnecessary information:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the title basics table, drop the following columns:\n",
    "\"original_title\" (we will use the primary title column instead)\n",
    "\"isAdult\" (\"Adult\" will show up in the genres so this is redundant information).\n",
    "\"titleType\" (every row will be a movie).\n",
    "\"genres\" and other variants of genre (genre is now represented in the 2 new tables described above.\n",
    "Do not include the title_akas table in your SQL database.\n",
    "You have already filtered out the desired movies using this table and the remaining data is mostly nulls and not of-interest to the stakeholder.\n",
    "MySQL Database Requirements\n",
    "Use sqlalchemy with pandas to execute your SQL queries inside your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new database on your MySQL server and call it \"movies\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to have the following tables in your \"movies\" database:\n",
    "\n",
    "title_basics\n",
    "title_ratings\n",
    "title_genres\n",
    "genres\n",
    "tmdb_data\n",
    "Make sure to set a Primary Key for each table that isn't a joiner table (e.g. title_genres is a joiner table).\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating each table, show the first 5 rows of that table using a SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to run the \"SHOW TABLES\" SQL query at the end of your notebook to show that all required tables have been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverables\n",
    "Submit a link to your github respository containing the Jupyter Notebook file."
